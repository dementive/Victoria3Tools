To enable syntax when you have a .txt file open go to:
`main menu -> view -> syntax -> Open All with current extention as... -> Victoria Tools`
Victoria Syntax should now show up for all your script files

# IMPORTANT

Go to
`Preferences -> Package Settings -> Victoria Tools -> Settings`
and make sure that both the path to game files and path to mod files settings are correct valid paths on your system.
Also add the full path to any mods you are working on to the mod files setting.
